# 👋 Hi, I'm Cap
I'm a systems-focused software engineer building **compilers**, **low-latency engines**, and **performance-critical infrastructure** in **Rust**.
- 🎓 Computer Science student graduated in **July 2025**
- 💻 Looking for **hybrid Rust/C++ systems roles in London**
- 📌 Strong interest in: **infra, protocol design, AI tooling, trading engines, multi-agent systems**
- 🔍 Long-term goal: Become a high-performance specialist in **compilers**, **GPU runtimes**, and **low-latency systems**
---
## 🧠 My Focus Areas
- 🧵 High-performance compilers and kernel fusion (e.g. ONNX/TorchScript)
- ⚡ Lock-free engines and real-time matching systems
- 🧬 AI infra, graph optimizers, and runtime tuning
- 🌐 Network protocols, concurrency models, and async runtimes
- 🤖 Multi-agent AI systems and orchestration frameworks
- 🖼️ Local-first applications with embedded ML and privacy-preserving design
- 💹 Trading infrastructure and financial systems engineering
