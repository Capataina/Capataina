# 👋 Hi, I'm Cap

I'm a systems-focused software engineer building **compilers**, **low-latency engines**, and **performance-critical infrastructure** in **Rust**.

- 🎓 Computer Science student graduated in **July 2025**
- 💻 Looking for **hybrid Rust/C++ systems roles in London**
- 📌 Strong interest in: **infra, protocol design, AI tooling, trading engines**
- 🔍 Long-term goal: Become a high-performance specialist in **compilers**, **GPU runtimes**, and **low-latency systems**

---

## 🧠 My Focus Areas

- 🧵 High-performance compilers and kernel fusion (e.g. ONNX/TorchScript)
- ⚡ Lock-free engines and real-time matching systems
- 🧬 AI infra, graph optimizers, and runtime tuning
- 🌐 Network protocols, concurrency models, and async runtimes

## 🚀 Projects I'm Working On

| 🔧 Project | 🧠 Tech | 📄 Summary |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| [Xyntra](https://github.com/Capataina/xyntra) | `Rust`, `egg`, `wgpu`, `ONNX` | Kernel-fusion compiler pass for ONNX/TorchScript graphs, emits fused GPU kernels using WGSL/PTX |
| [Zyphos](https://github.com/Capataina/zyphos) | `Rust`, `TCP`, `Threads`, `Concurrency` | Modular multithreaded HTTP server in Rust built from scratch with async-like threading model |
| [Nyquestro](https://github.com/Capataina/nyquestro) | `Rust`, `Atomics`, `Lock-Free` | Ultra-low-latency limit-order-book engine with lock-free price levels and correctness-tested matching logic |

## 🧭 Currently Exploring

- 🧪 Writing a research-style whitepaper on **kernel fusion design** (Xyntra)
- 📈 Benchmarking latency + throughput in **lock-free engines** (Nyquestro)
- ✍️ Publishing a research on the **math behind tensor algebra and kernel fusion** — covering rewrite rules, DAG transformations, and performance implications
